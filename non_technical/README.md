Thanks for asking about my salary expectations. Achieving a good work-life balance is really important to me, and that's why this position caught my attention. I understand that the salary range for this role is between 45,000 to 57,000 euros per year, which seems reasonable. Although my current salary is higher at around 90,000 euros per year, I'm willing to be flexible and make adjustments to prioritize a healthier work-life balance.

For me, it's not just about the salary. I also value job satisfaction, growth opportunities, and cultural fit with the company. I believe it's important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the position, its responsibilities, and the opportunities it offers before discussing specific numbers. Once I have a clearer picture of the role and how I can contribute, I'm confident that we can have a productive discussion about the compensation.
