### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What did you learn from your last project? (verify alignment with resume)`

In my previous project, I use Flink technology to consume data from Kafka and compute e-commence metrics. It was a valuable experience where I effectively communicated with the stakeholders and delivered high-quality results. Throughout the project, we encountered several instances of unexpected calculation results. To address the issue, I utilize techniques such as record logging, and comparing with offline detail data. By doing so, I ensured the accuracy of the data.

This project allowed me to become proficient in various technologies, including reading data from HBase, consuming data from Kafka, and writing data to both MySQL and Kafka. I successfully leveraged these technologies to meet project requirements efficiently.

Overall, this experience not only strengthened my technical skills but also honed my ability to collaborate with business stakeholders and troubleshoot issues effectively. I am confident that these skills and experiences will be valuable in future projects.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What are your compensation expectations?`
Thanks for asking about my salary expectations. Achieving a good work-life balance is really important to me, and that's why this position caught my attention. I understand that the salary range for this role is between 45,000 to 57,000 euros per year, which seems reasonable. Although my current salary is higher at around 90,000 euros per year, I'm willing to be flexible and make adjustments to prioritize a healthier work-life balance.

For me, it's not just about the salary. I also value job satisfaction, growth opportunities, and cultural fit with the company. I believe it's important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the position, its responsibilities, and the opportunities it offers before discussing specific numbers. Once I have a clearer picture of the role and how I can contribute, I'm confident that we can have a productive discussion about the compensation.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What is the notice period you would need if you were hired?`

If I were offered the position, I'd appreciate a notice period of about 1.5 to 2 months. My current job is pretty demanding, and I want to make sure I leave things in good hands. It'll take me around a month to wrap up my responsibilities and hand over any ongoing projects. Plus, I'll need another couple of weeks to pack up and settle down in Italy. So, having 1.5 to 2 months of notice would give me the right amount of time to make a smooth transition and hit the ground running in my new role.
