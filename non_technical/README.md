爱久

Hi there! My Chinese name is Bojian Sun, my English name is Lionel, and I'm excited to introduce myself. I completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from Sapienza University of Rome. I had the opportunity to work in Italy for two and a half years, where I primarily provided data support for project management.

Currently, I am working at Temu, which is part of the Pinduoduo company, and I have been with them for two years now. In October last year, I joined the Temu project, and it has been an enriching experience. My role at Temu involves various technologies such as Hive, Flink, Kafka, Hadoop, Java, and Python. I have been responsible for developing data reports that provide valuable insights for COO decision-making.

Throughout my professional journey, I have developed strong skills in data streaming development, project management, and utilizing cutting-edge technologies. I am passionate about data to drive strategic decision-making and improve operational efficiency.

Beyond my technical expertise, I am a highly motivated and collaborative team player. I thrive in dynamic and challenging environments, where I can contribute my skills and learn from others. I believe in continuous learning and staying updated with the latest industry trends.

I'm excited to have the opportunity to further discuss my experiences and how I can contribute to the agile lab. Thank you for considering my application.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Why did you join and leave your last three positions?`

In my previous three positions, I had different reasons for joining and leaving. Let me tell you about it.

In my first and second jobs, I worked for the same client in a consultant role. When my contract with the first company ended, it was likely due to a decrease in the client's project share, and they didn't offer me a renewal. Fortunately, the second company extended an offer to me, and since the work was still related to the same project, I decided to join them. However, the job responsibilities remained unchanged.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic severely impacted our project, and after my contract expired, there wasn't an opportunity for renewal. Concerned about the situation and my family's well-being, I made the decision to return to China. I then joined Pinduoduo, one of the largest e-commerce companies in China, as I believed a larger company would provide more opportunities for personal growth.

Later in October of last year, I joined the Temu project, which had rapid and exciting development. I learned a lot during my time there. However, one drawback was that the workload was consistently high, I once worked nearly 60 days without a break. which took a toll on my physical and mental well-being. I realized that I needed to find a job that offered a better work-life balance.

Currently, I have a strong desire to return to Italy as I am drawn to its environment and culture. I'm seeking a job that allows me to achieve a balance between work and personal life. The combination of my preference for Italy and the need for a healthier work situation is what motivated me to make this decision.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Why did you apply with Agile Lab?`

I was attracted to Agile Lab for several reasons. Firstly, I learned that Agile Lab was recognized as one of Europe's 1000 fastest-growing companies in both 2021 and 2022. This impressive achievement reflects the company's dynamic and forward-thinking approach.

I was particularly interested in Agile Lab's innovative technologies such as Witboost and Data Mesh. The company's name itself, 'Agile,' means its ability to adapt to changing needs and technologies. I aspire to agile think and to constantly learn and apply new technologies to meet new challenges.

Furthermore, Agile Lab offers flexible work arrangements, including the option for remote work, which I believe can greatly enhance productivity. The company truly values work-life balance, and this aligns with my desire to have a fulfilling and balanced professional and personal life.

I also noticed that Agile Lab provides comprehensive training and support for its employees, both in terms of time and financial investment. This commitment to professional development is crucial for me as I seek continuous growth in my career. Additionally, the fact that Agile Lab is actively recruiting engineers at different levels indicates a clear career progression and advancement system within the company. This offers me the opportunity for long-term stability and the ability to continually enhance my skills within a structured career path.

Overall, I am excited about the prospect of joining Agile Lab because of its impressive growth, focus on cutting-edge technologies, commitment to work-life balance, and opportunities for career advancement and skill development that the company offers.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What did you learn from your last project? (verify alignment with resume)`

In my previous project, we implemented a Lambda architecture to develop a data dashboard for our business needs.  The architecture involved utilizing both real-time and batch processing technologies, with Flink for real-time processing and Hive for offline processing.

We used Hive, a powerful data warehousing framework for the offline processing component. We designed and implemented Hive queries and workflows to process large volumes of data in batches. This involved performing complex transformations, aggregations, and calculations to generate comprehensive reports and analyses. The offline processing ensured that we had complete and accurate data, and the results were eventually used to update the real-time metrics.

I use Flink technology to consume data from Kafka and compute e-commence metrics. It was a valuable experience where I effectively communicated with the stakeholders and delivered high-quality results. Throughout the project, we encountered several instances of unexpected calculation results. I utilize techniques such as record logging and comparing with offline detail data to address the issue. By doing so, I ensured the accuracy of the data.

This project made me proficient in various technologies, including reading data from HBase, consuming data from Kafka, and writing data to both MySQL and Kafka. I successfully leveraged these technologies to meet project requirements efficiently.

Overall, this experience strengthened my technical skills and honed my ability to collaborate with business stakeholders and troubleshoot issues effectively. I am confident that these skills and experiences will be valuable in future projects.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What is your experience with X? (for each of the skills listed in the position description)`

I have a solid foundation and practical experience in working with a range of technologies, including Hadoop, Hive, Flink, Kafka, Java, and Python.

I have worked on data ingestion, processing, and analysis using Hive, which involved writing complex queries and optimizing performance.

Regarding Flink, I have utilized it for real-time data streaming and processing. I have developed Flink applications to handle large-scale data streams, perform transformations, and apply analytics to derive meaningful insights. For data streaming and messaging, I have worked extensively with Kafka. I have experience in producing and consuming messages, and integrating Kafka with other databases in the data pipeline. 

In terms of programming languages, I have a strong command of Java, which I have used for developing Flink applications. Additionally, I also use Python for data processing, scripting, and building machine learning models.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What are your compensation expectations?`
Thanks for asking about my salary expectations. Achieving a good work-life balance is really important to me, and that's why this position caught my attention. I understand that the salary range for this role is between 45,000 to 57,000 euros per year, which seems reasonable. Although my current salary is higher at around 90,000 euros per year, I'm willing to be flexible and make adjustments to prioritize a healthier work-life balance.

For me, it's not just about the salary. I also value job satisfaction, growth opportunities, and cultural fit with the company. I believe it's important to have a more comprehensive understanding of the position, its responsibilities, and the opportunities it offers before discussing specific numbers. Once I have a clearer picture of the role and how I can contribute, I'm confident that we can have a productive discussion about the compensation.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `What is the notice period you would need if you were hired?`

If I were offered the position, I'd appreciate a notice period of about 1.5 to 2 months. My current job is pretty demanding, and I want to make sure I leave things in good hands. It'll take me around a month to wrap up my responsibilities and hand over any ongoing projects. Plus, I'll need another couple of weeks to pack up and settle down in Italy. So, having 1.5 to 2 months of notice would give me the right amount of time to make a smooth transition and hit the ground running in my new role.

### ![#1589F0](https://placehold.it/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Why are you looking for a new position? `

I'm currently working at Temu, and it's been an incredible experience. The company has been rapidly expanding, and we've successfully established a presence in major European and American regions. The technical competence of my colleagues has been outstanding, and I've had the opportunity to learn a great deal during my time here.

However, the requirement of the job has led me to consider new opportunities. At Temu, the work hours have been quite extensive, with an average of 13 hours spent at the office each day, including a one-hour break for lunch and dinner. I typically work six days a week, and there have been instances where I've gone nearly 60 days without a day off. This huge workload has taken a toll on both my physical and mental well-being, leaving me feeling tired, stressed, and struggling with insomnia.

For my health and overall well-being, I'm seeking a healthier work-life balance. I believe that finding a position that allows me to have a more balanced and fulfilling lifestyle is essential. I value the lessons and experiences gained at Temu, but I feel it's time for me to prioritize my own health and seek a more sustainable work environment.
